# Project combining Express and React

- Contains "two" parts: server and client
- Server provides an API using express. Only responsible for sending json data.
- Client is a standard vite-react app
- Start the server with `npm run server`.
- Start the client with `npm run client`. You may need to open two terminals.
- By default server is at port 3000 and client is at port 5173
